# Understanding Typescript 2K20
> Notes related to the course by Maximilian

## Prerequisites 

1. Node (for compiling the javascript code)
2. Typescript (for compiling the typescript code)

## Modules 

Each module is listed in an ascending order on different topics covered with typescript. Within each module, there exists two folders **src** and **dist**. The src folder contains all the typescript code. Within the terminal when you want to compile the typescript code, you use the command `tsc`. With this, all the javascript code is stored within the **dist** folder. To test the results of the javascript code, move into the module folder and within dist and use the command `node <filename>`.
